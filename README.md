# RepeatAfterMe3
 
Repeat after me is a simple sequenced based puzzle game, based on the classic SIMON game developed in 1978. A button sequence is played and then must be repeated by the player in order to progress. With each correct entry a further value is added to the ever increasing sequence, testing the users attention and memory. With every correct sequence, move your character a step closer to the finish line.
